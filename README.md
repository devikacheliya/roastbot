# Roastbot üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: Dead on Deployment  :‚îÉ


### Team Members
- Team Lead: [Devika K] - [St.Joseph's College, Devagiri]
- Member 2: [Gowri Laxmi] - [St.Joseph's College, Devagiri]


### Project Description
[Roastbot is a delightfully chaotic, AI-infused web application designed to turn procrastination into pure entertainment.
This project combines satire, interactivity, and cultural flavor to roast, gaslight, or ‚Äúencourage‚Äù users based on how much (or little) they‚Äôve studied.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Usually apps are there to motivate us, there isn't one that is not helping us but roasting us instead.]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[The app has many modes and we can click on it to get roasted. There is also Malayali Amma's always used dialogues.]
